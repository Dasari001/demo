        <p id = "para2">Why did Iron Man have to die? His sacrifice was a 
            key part of saving the 
            universe in Avengers: Endgame, and the universe 
            may have had no other 
            choice â€“ Iron Man may have been the real threat all along. 
            Robert Downey 
            Jr.'s genius billionaire playboy philanthropist was the face 
            of the Marvel
             Cinematic Universe for over a decade. Iron Man launched the MCU back in 
             2008 and played a pivotal role in what is now known as the 
             Infinity Saga.
              He proved to be one of the MCU franchise's greatest heroes
               and put his 
              life on the line multiple times before paying the ultimate price in 
              Avengers: Endgame.
